## 📦 Product/Shop Images (6 items)

**Location:** `src/api/product.js`

**Note:** These appear to be book titles (legal/business books). For an IT distribution company, these don't fit the context.

**Recommendation:** Either remove the shop section or replace with actual IT products:

If keeping shop:
- **sp1-sp6:** Enterprise software packages, hardware products, or service packages
- **Unsplash:** https://unsplash.com/photos/macbook-pro-on-brown-wooden-table-lRoX0shwjUQ
- **Pexels:** https://www.pexels.com/photo/laptop-technology-ipad-tablet-35550/

---

## 🤝 Partner Logos (9 partner companies)

**Location:** `src/components/PartnerSection/PartnerSection.js`, `src/components/PartnerSection2/PartnerSectionS2.js`

**Recommendation:** Use actual vendor/partner logos:
- Microsoft (download from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks)
- AWS (download from: https://aws.amazon.com/brands/)
- Dell (download from: https://www.dell.com)
- HP Enterprise
- Cisco
- Lenovo
- VMware
- Azure
- IBM

**Alternative placeholder approach:**
- Use simple grayscale logo placeholders
- **Placeholder generator:** https://placeholder.com/
- Example: `https://via.placeholder.com/200x80/CCCCCC/666666?text=Partner+Logo`
